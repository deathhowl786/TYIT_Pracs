# 1. Rule 1: Identify teachers -- A person is a teacher if they teach at least one course
# (Anyone who teaches any course is a teacher.)
Teacher(X) <= Teaches(X, Y)

# 2. Rule 2: Students NOT enrolled in any course -- Negation: Students not enrolled in any course
# (Use of ~ (negation): If a student is not enrolled in any course, return them. Returns 'dan' in this case.)
NotEnrolled(X) <= Student(X) & ~(EnrolledIn(X, Y))

# 3. Rule 3: Honors students -- Honors student rule: student enrolled in AI and Math is honors
# ( A student is honors if they are enrolled in both AI and Math. Only 'alice' matches.)
HonorsStudent(X) <= EnrolledIn(X, 'AI') & EnrolledIn(X, 'Math')

# 4. Rule 4: Count courses each professor teaches -- Count number of courses a professor teaches (complex rule)
# (Use len_() to count how many times a professor appears in the Teaches predicate.)

# 5. Rule 5: Overloaded professors -- A professor is overloaded if they teach more than 2 courses
